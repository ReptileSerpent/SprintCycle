# SprintCycle

This is a SCRUM team management simulation game. It is intended to help people get acquainted with some of the practices of SCRUM in a (hopefully) fun way. Do note the simulation is probably not completely accurate in some respects.

The game is currently in early development. Feedback, bug reports and feature requests are welcome!

Builds are available for Android, Linux and Windows, see [releases](https://github.com/ReptileSerpent/SprintCycle/releases). Android is considered the primary platform.
